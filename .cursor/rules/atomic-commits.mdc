  Encourage small, atomic commits by avoiding large-scale changes to entire folders unless explicitly necessary.
globs:
  - "src/**"                 # Source code (keep changes focused)
  - "tests/**"               # Test files (avoid sweeping changes)
  - "scripts/**"             # Scripts (avoid refactor-wide changes)
